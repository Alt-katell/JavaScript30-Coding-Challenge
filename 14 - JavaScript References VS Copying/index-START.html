    // Let's say we have an array
    let players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    let team1 = players;
    console.log(players, team1);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!
    team1[0] = 'Katell';
    console.log(players, team1);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    let team2 = players.slice();
    team2[1] = 'Sylvain';
    console.log(players, team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[2] = 'Pierre';
    console.log(players, team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Magali';
    console.log(players, team4);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // Other method
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    let captain1 = person;
    console.log(person, captain1)

    captain1.name = 'Katell';
    console.log(person, captain1)

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // Use the object ...spread
    let captain2 = {...person};
    captain2.age = 29;
    console.log(person, captain2)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    // Other method
    let captain3 = Object.assign({}, person, {name: 'Sylvain', age: 32})
    console.log(person, captain3)
